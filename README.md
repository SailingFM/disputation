# An HTML5 Astrophysics Talk

I recently had my last straw dealing with
[LibreOffice](http://libreoffice.org/) and decided to try to take the plunge
and make a scientific presentation using HTML5 and JavaScript. I was very
happy with how things went, so I thought I'd share how I did it.

Of course you can [check out the talk on a live
website](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~pwilliams/htmltalk/).

### Exporting the presentation in PDF

This is a bit of a hassle but is possible. Huzzah!

1. Open the presentation in Google Chrome, launching Chrome with
   the flag ``--allow-file-access-from-files``.
2. Edit the URL to end with the query ``?print-pdf``.
3. Print with ``Ctrl-P`` as usual. Various options may need to be set:
  - *Destination* to *Save as PDF*
  - *Layout* to *Landscape*
  - *Margins* to *None*
  - *Background colors and images* option *enabled*
4. Save it.
