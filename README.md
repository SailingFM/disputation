### Exporting the presentation in PDF

This is a bit of a hassle but is possible. Huzzah!

1. Open the presentation in Google Chrome, launching Chrome with
   the flag ``--allow-file-access-from-files``.
2. Edit the URL to end with the query ``?print-pdf``.
3. Print with ``Ctrl-P`` as usual. Various options may need to be set:
  - *Destination* to *Save as PDF*
  - *Layout* to *Landscape*
  - *Margins* to *None*
  - *Background colors and images* option *enabled*
4. Save it.
